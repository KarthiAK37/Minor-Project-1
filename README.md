# Minor-Project-1
A hardware-based project that detects vehicles with high-beam headlights using a lux sensor and ESP32. Captures images of violators and sends them via Telegram for enforcement and road safety.
# 🚦 Automated Lux Meter for Vehicle Headlight Monitoring

A Second-year college project focused on **detecting vehicles with excessively bright headlights** using a dual-microcontroller system, light sensors, and image capture. This device helps law enforcement improve road safety by enforcing headlight brightness standards.

## 📍 What It Does
- Measures headlight brightness using a silicon sensor
- Detects high-beam violations using a lux threshold
- Captures vehicle images when brightness exceeds safe limits
- Sends evidence via Telegram bot for enforcement

## 💡 Highlights
- ESP32 microcontroller-based design
- LED display for live lux values
- Telegram bot integration for instant reporting
- Tested in real-world lighting conditions
